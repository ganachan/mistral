ServiceNow Enters the CRM Market with a Bold Declaration
During its 2025 Partner Kickoff, ServiceNow made a bold announcement:

“We are in CRM.”

This statement came from John Ball, SVP & GM of CRM Workflows at ServiceNow, as he celebrated the company’s leader position in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for CRM Customer Engagement Center.

For years, ServiceNow refrained from explicitly using the term "CRM". However, its Customer Service Management (CSM) platform has increasingly evolved into a full-fledged CRM solution.

A CRM-Like Evolution
ServiceNow’s CSM platform now includes:
✔ Omnichannel support
✔ Case management
✔ Self-service & knowledge management
✔ Proactive outreach
✔ Conversational intelligence
✔ 360-degree customer view

As ServiceNow continued adding these capabilities, its platform attracted significant new business. CEO Bill McDermott emphasized this momentum during the company’s latest earnings call:

“[We’re] growing faster than markets, especially the customer service management market.”

Yet, ServiceNow is not positioning itself as a direct competitor to traditional, out-of-the-box CRM providers. Instead, its strength lies in complex service delivery, leveraging deep integrations with ERP and back-end systems.

With AI-powered automation layered over customer service workflows, ServiceNow aims to deliver a more data-rich CRM experience than existing players in the market.

The AI-Powered CRM Advantage
Industry experts recognize ServiceNow’s unique value proposition. Martin Schneider, VP & Principal Analyst at Constellation Research, recently noted:

“Because of its history, knowledge, and deep data integration, ServiceNow can provide insights and capabilities that others can’t. Their business relationships are also a huge advantage.”

ServiceNow has access to detailed product, customer, and interaction data—combined with unstructured data management. When integrated with AI, this creates a powerful platform that connects seamlessly with:
✔ Order management
✔ Invoicing
✔ Inventory

With Agentic AI enabling unprecedented automation and efficiency in service workflows, ServiceNow enters the CRM market at a pivotal moment.

Challenges for ServiceNow in the CRM Space
Despite its strengths, ServiceNow faces key challenges as it expands into the CRM domain.

1️⃣ Cost & Complexity
Unlike Salesforce, which offers a plug-and-play solution for businesses of all sizes, ServiceNow requires significant setup and customization.

Companies that successfully implement ServiceNow often invest heavily in connecting service and engagement touchpoints across the enterprise.

2️⃣ Market Positioning
ServiceNow’s marketing focuses on high-level messaging around employees, customers, finance, and procurement. Now, it must equip partners and sales teams to take this message beyond IT and into the hands of CX and service leaders.

3️⃣ Bridging the CRM Buyer Gap
While IT plays a growing role in CRM buying decisions—thanks to AI adoption—final purchasing authority often rests with business leaders in customer service and CX.

ServiceNow must actively engage with these teams and demonstrate the benefits of integrating the contact center into the broader enterprise ecosystem.

Strategic Moves to Overcome These Challenges
✅ Expanding Partnerships with CCaaS Vendors
In 2024, ServiceNow strengthened its presence in the contact center space, forging co-innovation partnerships with:
✔ Five9
✔ Genesys
✔ Zoom

By building on these relationships, ServiceNow can justify its greater platform complexity while showcasing its AI-powered efficiencies.

✅ Investing in AI Expertise
As Rebecca Wetteman, CEO & Principal Analyst at Valoir, explains:

“Simply handing customers a bunch of AI tools and expecting them to figure it out hasn’t proven to be a winning strategy so far.”

Recognizing this, ServiceNow recently pledged to hire 3,000 new employees—a move that will support its CRM ambitions by ensuring expert-led integrations.

Who Should Consider ServiceNow for CRM?
ServiceNow isn’t aiming for traditional CRM buyers. Instead, its CRM solution best serves:

🔹 Large enterprises that require a unified service management approach
🔹 Organizations looking to integrate customer service with back-office operations
🔹 Businesses already leveraging ServiceNow for ITSM or other enterprise workflows

Industry Endorsements
In a popular LinkedIn post, Emil Lundvall, Head of ServiceNow Practice Sweden for KPMG, highlighted the significance of this evolution:

“This isn’t just a platform update; it’s a game-changer.”

“By integrating AI-driven agents and automation, ServiceNow is set to revolutionize customer engagement, driving efficiency and enhancing every step of the customer journey.”

“From predictive insights to seamless interactions, this is next-level CRM that will empower organizations to deliver personalized, data-driven experiences at scale.”

While ServiceNow still faces adoption hurdles, companies already using its platform can seamlessly extend it to customer-facing workflows—making it a strong contender in the enterprise CRM space.

ServiceNow’s Next Steps in CRM
At the 2025 Partner Kickoff, ServiceNow also announced the acquisition of Cuein, a “copilot for customer experience teams”—further solidifying its CRM strategy.

As ServiceNow enters this space, it will challenge Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, and Oracle, but with a unique focus:

An AI-powered, enterprise-grade CRM that deeply integrates with the entire business—not just the contact center.
